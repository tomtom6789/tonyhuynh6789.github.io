    Sinatra project prepared me an absolute comprehension of the way Rails works.  The MVC framework was pretty straight forward, and Active Record gives us the convenient easily to manage the database. Especially, Association is very supportive in rails as it serves the relationship as making connection for all objects.  But, figuring out the appropriate types of models and their relationship was touch. It was really worthy to take time to understand and correct the rapport between models. Provided that, association is also extremely a crucial part in order build the rails project. 

    In addition, I was able to apply helper methods, validations, nested form, and nested routes to the project smoothly without meeting much challenge. Validations are very helpful there is a necessity to check for presence and uniqueness for attributes. I also recognize the scope method is significant useful when it comes to querying the database. For instant, I build the Laptop-Sales website, and I liked to list the most expensive, new laptops. This is where the scope methods came in to cooperate. 

    Further, I chose to go with google for the onmniauth as its popular.  The installation is completed uncomplicatedly.  The server started connecting google login after the set-up.   The final things perform on the project is to editing Views and add a simple bootstrap to my front end. I wish I had more time to embellish the interface. 

    Overall, this was a challenging project to work on I am advantaged as I improved on constructing models and relationship, picked up omniauth. Now that Iâ€™ve built a complex project, I am keenly aware of how easy to get into a mess with Associations and will be more vigilant about it in future project.
