Final Blog at Flatiron	

   I came to Flatiron with a little knowledge of coding, and I am leaving it with the ability of developing a full web application. I believe I made the right choice and took the opportunity to join Full-time Online Software Engineering course.  During the course, we have live lectures daily and one on one meeting with instructor weekly. Live Lectures were taking place in every morning which is very early compare to my time-zone, so I could not attend the live one regularly due I could not manage the time because of my kid.  Fortunately, all lectures were being recorded by the instructor to give the accessibility for students who does not have the chance catching the live lecture.
	 
   Moreover, one on one meeting with instructor weekly is very helpful as I could stack up a list of question I have with the labs and lectures, and we went together step by step throughout the problem until I comprehended. Indeed, all projects created opportunities for us to apply what we had learned in each module to make an app the way we like it to work. I found this is really helpful as it builds the solid foundation for deeper understanding and experiencing the lectures we had passed. And, by having project reviews by the different instructor likes putting students in real technical interviews which is beneficial for us in the future carrier. 
	 
   In summary, joining Flatiron was one of the best decisions Iâ€™ve ever made. They have really taken the time to create programs that challenge you with every lesson and make sure to go the extra step in getting you ready for landing that first tech job.
