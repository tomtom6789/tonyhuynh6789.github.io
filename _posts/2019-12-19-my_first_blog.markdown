 I love reading articles, I thought it would be interesting to scrape an article website about coding.  I decided to scrape a CLI Gem that would scrape https://learntocodewith.me/blog/, to give user data about all articles listed on Homepage with their published dates and contents. Since I am expressly learning to code, I found the project would be extremely informative and significant supportive.
 
 To start with, I went through the project instruction, and my original approach to coding this was based on Avi's video, CLI Gem Walkthrough.  Everything has been gone great; my initial ideas are to give usersâ€™ options to access the list of titles and their contents.  That, I would go one level deep of scraping to grab the full content for all articles.  In addition, I assumed it would be super useful if users perceive the moment the articles were disclosed, I supplemented published date and time following by tittles.  

  Indeed, I firstly used Nokogiri to parse and interpret the page before I used my top-down approach to choose the list of titles.  The app presents a list of 4 articles to choose from. Once the selection is being made, the new instance of the Scraper method and Article class are created simultaneously. Then, all the scrapers methods are ready to do their things in order. On the other hands, the scraper method is able to return list of tittles and published dates.  The users would be prompted to select their interesting article to continue, and they would be given options to review other articles or to exit the application.

  Briefly, a great project. I was incredibly excited to go out to work and challenge on my own without using asking a question on learn.co.  All that experiments and errors throughout the process would be benefit experiences
