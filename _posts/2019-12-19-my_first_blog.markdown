This my example.
Congrats! Itâ€™s time to work on your first project. In this lesson you're going to build a Ruby gem that provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to an external data source. The CLI will be composed of an Object Oriented Ruby application. You'll use all you've learned about Ruby and CLI Applications in Ruby to complete this project.

Please note that while you will be writing code to scrape data or utilize an API from a public website, we are really looking for you to demonstrate your ability to write concise, easy-to-read Object-Oriented Ruby code (e.g. objects, not hashes; separation of concerns). The details of the regex's or the selectors you use to parse your scraped web pages are less important.
