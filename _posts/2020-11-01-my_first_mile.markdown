   I started on online software engineering program at the Flatiron recently.  I graduated with BS in Information Technology in the summer of 2019. I had been thinking about working in networking field, so I have not focus on programming very much when I was in college. After graduation I had given myself a break, and I suddenly remembered I bought a C# sharp course from Udemy while I was in college, but I had not had a chance to complete it.

   Indeed, I started getting interested as long as I dove deeper into it. I started to watch coding videos on the YouTube, and it was a coincidence that I clicked and watched video from improving and learning programming skills through Bootcamps. I was curious and started researching for the best Bootcamp I had spent roughly 2 months, and I found out the Flatiron School. Hence, I tried out the Flatiron bootcamp prep and decided to go with this Bootcamp.
	
   Further, I was given an interview and required to complete 117 lessons in the First Mile curriculum. I started putting restriction on myself to not do secondary things but focus on finishing this requirement in a week as I felt like itâ€™s beneficial to create this habit. Equally, I set up the schedule for myself to spend 40 hours a week likes the requirement. So, everything went very well, and I was motivated and excited to sit and code every day. Of course, I felt I made the right decision to be with Flatiron.
