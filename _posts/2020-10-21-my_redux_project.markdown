Finally, I completed the project I took idea from my previous project to build this Single Page Application. I design a simple site where users can add and sell their used or old laptops on the page. Besides, there are update and delete actions that gives users flexibility to make modify on the item they added.

At the early stage, I thought I would like time to build User Authentication which makes sense to have in my app, but I could not manage the time to have it done. However. I could meet all requirements. I started off with building rails API backend that I set up model, controller, relationship, and cors. Even more, I configured Serializer to format out JSON on the backend and frontend which benefits for dataâ€™s manipulation.

Further, I initially made the GET request to the backend to fetch all laptops to the Dom. I developed the Post request to add new laptop after that. I continue adding Delete and Patch request to give users the delete and update options. Yet, I had faced a little challenge when I tried to turn my code into Object Orientation that I originally wrote all of my code in index.js, but I focused on moving each function at the time I could alleviate the error to solve. I set relationship between two models then.

Overall, I would say the project was challenging, but it is advantageous that it wraps up the entire things we learned from the curriculum. Now I could build the backend and frontend web application which I had never I could.
